## Security Considerations

### Hardware Security

This component controls physical devices (covers, blinds, etc.). Consider these security aspects:

#### Physical Access
- Secure your ESP devices physically
- Use tamper-evident enclosures when appropriate
- Consider the physical security implications of device placement

#### Network Security
- Use secure WiFi (WPA3/WPA2 with strong passwords)
- Consider network segmentation for IoT devices
- Regular security updates for your network infrastructure

#### Device Configuration
- Change default passwords and credentials
- Use strong, unique passwords for device access
- Disable unnecessary network services

### Software Security

#### ESPHome Security
- Keep ESPHome updated to the latest version
- Review and audit custom configurations
- Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS, encrypted MQTT)

#### Home Assistant Integration
- Secure your Home Assistant instance
- Use HTTPS for remote access
- Regular backups of configurations

#### Configuration Security
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in YAML files
- Use ESPHome secrets for sensitive data
- Review permissions for external integrations

### Common Security Best Practices

#### Network
```yaml
# Example: Secure WiFi configuration
wifi:
  ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  password: !secret wifi_password
  # Use static IP for better security tracking
  manual_ip:
    static_ip: 192.168.1.100
    gateway: 192.168.1.1
    subnet: 255.255.255.0
```

#### API Security
```yaml
# Example: Secure API configuration
api:
  password: !secret api_password
  encryption:
    key: !secret api_encryption_key
```

#### OTA Security
```yaml
# Example: Secure OTA updates
ota:
  password: !secret ota_password
```

### Known Security Considerations

#### Physical Safety
- **Safety Timeouts**: Always configure appropriate timeouts to prevent physical damage
- **Emergency Stops**: Implement emergency stop mechanisms where possible
- **Position Limits**: Verify position calculations to prevent over-travel

#### Electrical Safety
- **Relay Protection**: Use appropriate relay protection (fuses, circuit breakers)
- **Isolation**: Ensure proper electrical isolation from mains voltage
- **Ground Fault Protection**: Use GFCI protection where required

### Security Updates

#### Automatic Updates
- ESPHome supports OTA updates - use them responsibly
- Test updates in non-production environments first
- Maintain backup configurations

#### Manual Security Reviews
Regular review checklist:
- [ ] ESPHome version up to date
- [ ] Network security configuration current
- [ ] Device passwords changed from defaults
- [ ] Physical security adequate
- [ ] Backup configurations current

### Incident Response

If you suspect a security breach:

1. **Isolate** affected devices immediately
2. **Document** the incident details
3. **Report** to maintainers following the process above
4. **Update** all potentially affected devices
5. **Review** and improve security measures
